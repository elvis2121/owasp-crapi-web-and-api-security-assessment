# OWASP crAPI Web and API Security Assessment

## Objective
Executed a structured security assessment against a local OWASP crAPI deployment and translated technical proof into prioritized, business-readable findings.

### Skills Learned
- Enumerated directories and fingerprinted the application stack.
- Manipulated object identifiers to test ownership enforcement.
- Changed a JWT algorithm to none and removed the signature to test verification.
- Sent 50+ invalid login attempts to evaluate throttling and lockout.
- Tested SQL and MongoDB-style payloads and reviewed responses for sensitive disclosure.
- Consolidated duplicate observations into eight unique prioritized findings.

### Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- Gobuster
- Wappalyzer
- JWT tooling
- Postman
- Docker
- manual API testing

## Steps

*Ref 1: Gobuster enumerates the crAPI host on 127.0.0.1:9000 and identifies live paths such as /health returning HTTP 200.*

*Ref 2: Wappalyzer fingerprints the crAPI web application and identifies the front-end and supporting technologies exposed in the browser.*

*Ref 3: Burp Repeater shows that changing the user identifier from 8 to 3 returns another user's data, demonstrating broken object-level authorization.*

*Ref 4: Burp captures the login response returning access and refresh JWTs for the authenticated session.*

*Ref 5: The JWT decoder exposes token header and claim values, including role and account identifiers, before tampering tests.*

*Ref 6: The JWT is modified by setting the algorithm to none and removing the signature to test token integrity validation.*

*Ref 7: Burp Repeater shows the API accepting the unsigned modified JWT and returning a normal response, confirming missing JWT signature verification.*
